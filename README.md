# Deep Learning-Based CS under IQ imbalance For Channel Estimation of mmWave phased arrays

## Introduction
In this repository, we approach the problem of IQ imbalance in channel estimation of mmWave phased arrays from a compressed sensing/neural network point of view. \
We refer the interested reader to the pdf file Data_Compression__Deep_Learning_Based_CS_under_IQ_Imbalance.pdf for a full report on the problem and the approach.

## Methodology
We use autoencoder based compressed sensing to reconstruct the chanell from limited measurements, allowing us to find a good approximation of the original channel of size 100 from just 40 measurements!

A visual representation of the measurement model is given below
